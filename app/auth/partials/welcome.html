    Welcome to Pawsitive.  A site where you can search for dogs in need of a home from your local rescue shelters.  Or, if you are a shelter, you can create an account to post your own dogs.  
    You can view a dog and additional information that may help you decide if that dog is the right fit for your home.  If you think you may be interested in a dog, you may select the "interested" option to save that dog so you can view it later on.  If you are not interested in a dog, you can click the "not interested" option to remove that dog from your view. Please log in or create an account to get started.

    Many of the dogs on this website have found amazing homes!  Every day, we count on you all to help these dogs out and find a better life!

        Did you know?  Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats). The number of dogs and cats euthanized in U.S. shelters annually has declined from approximately 2.6 million in 2011.

        Many shelters provide post-adoption support. Make sure to ask about the groupâ€™s return policy and any extras, like training help or recommendations, a hotline you can call if you have questions, a follow-up veterinary exam, or coupons for supplies or pet insurance.
