Welcome to Pawsitive!  A website where local rescue shelters can create an account and post dogs that are currently in their shelter.
Users can create an account and view those dogs and either click interested and not interested.  If they click interested, 
the dog is saved to their database.  They can choose to fill out an application for the dog, chat with other users, view all the
shelters listed, or send the shelter an email.  Scroll down to view some snippits of the site.
